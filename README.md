## Requirements:

#### Docker, docker-compose to run script

### Or if you don't install them yet, you can run:

#### `sh install.sh` to install docker and docker-compose

### Or just skip them, and `npm` instead to use the application manually.


## Install

#### `make install-app up-app` to install and run the application with docker

### OR

#### `npm i && npm start` to run app manually

### Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Test: Unit test with Jest and React Testing. Automation test with Selenium IDE.

#### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### OR

#### Import `calculator.side` to Selenium IDE to run all the tests from test suite.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `make logs` to see logs

#### `make into-app` to use docker exec

## Build

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
